A small application that let's you change line endings in a text file, i.e. switch between CR (Mac), LF (Linux/UNIX) or CR+LF (Windows).

This not my work, just thought it would be a nice idea to share the source, since it's published under GPL v2.

Please do not open any issues, I'm not planing on fixing them, this is just an archival repository.
